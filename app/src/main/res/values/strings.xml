His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[8] Kohli\'s formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[9] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.[10]\n\nIn 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, who\'d espoused his younger son\'s fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli\'s aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma, who initially perceived him to be just another enthusiastic and determined young boy. However, two weeks later, Sharma was impressed by Kohli\'s accuracy and power in throwing.[11] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli\'s father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[12] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, not due to a lack of merit but due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals, as he was determined that Kohli should earn his recognition based on his own merit and overcome the system of nepotism and deceit prevalent in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). Kohli persisted and eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[13]</string>

They spent their days swimming and enjoying life, but little did they know, danger was about to strike. One day, two fishermen passed by the pond and saw the fish. Excited by their discovery, they decided to return the next day to catch them. The clever fish overheard the fishermens plan. Without wasting time, it quickly swam to its friends and warned them of the danger. The wise fish, understanding the severity of the situation, said, We must leave the pond immediately and find another safe place before the fishermen return.</string>

But the carefree fish, who loved the pond and didn’t want to leave, laughed and said, Oh, I’ve been here my whole life! I’ll be fine. The fishermen won\'t catch me. The next day, the fishermen came as planned. They cast their nets into the pond, and while the wise and clever fish were safe in their new home, the carefree fish was caught in the net. The story reminds us that being clever and wise can help us avoid danger, while ignoring warnings may lead to trouble.</string>

The other frogs, seeing the depth of the pit, discourage them from trying to escape, assuming they are doomed. Despite the negative comments, one frog persists in trying to jump out, while the other eventually gives up and tragically falls to its death.</string>

One day, while working near a river, his axe accidentally fell into the water. Distraught as his axe was his only means of income, Ram prayed for help. Moved by his sincerity, God appeared before him and offered to help. God first retrieved a silver axe from the river and asked if it belonged to Ram. Though tempted, Ram refused, saying it wasn’t his. Next, God pulled out a golden axe, but again, Ram honestly said that it wasn’t his axe. Finally, God retrieved Ram’s iron axe, and Ram gratefully accepted it. Impressed by Ram\'s honesty and integrity, God rewarded him by giving him the silver and golden axes along with his own. Ram accepted them with a grateful heart and continued to live an honest, contented life, no longer poor.</string>

One day, while wandering in the forest, he encountered a hungry fox. The fox, known for being sly, sweet-talked the rooster, saying, Dear Rooster, I have heard about your wonderful voice. Would you sing for me? The rooster, sensing the fox\'s cunning intentions, decided to outsmart him. Pretending to agree, the rooster said, Of course, I’ll sing for you, but first, you must close your eyes and bow your head in respect. The fox, eager to pounce on the rooster, did as he was told, closing his eyes and lowering his head. Seizing the opportunity, the rooster quickly flew up to a high tree branch, safely out of the fox’s reach. Realizing he had been tricked, the fox tried to convince the rooster to come down, but the rooster, now aware of the fox\'s deceit, refused to listen. He knew he had outwitted the fox, so he stayed safely perched on the branch, watching as the fox slinked away in defeat.</string>
